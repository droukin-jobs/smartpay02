## 1 INTRO

This project was designed as a main requirement for Smartpay job test (started a 16.00 18-04-2018 NZT, will be handed in by 16.00 20-04-2018). 

At the moment the following features are complete:
 - Endpoint to create new terminals
 - Endpoint to list terminals
 - Endpoint to view terminal details
 - Each connection runs in it's own thread
 - Tests for helper functions
 - Documentation (you are reading it)

Partially complete features:
 - Terminal creation is done only by empty POST request to `/terminal` endpoint
 - Terminals have only dummy transactions
 - Terminals structure is able to accept transactions, but the actual mechanism is not ready

Not implemented features:
 - JSON POST input to create terminals
 - JSON POST input to update transactions
 - Comprehensive main program testing
 - Server config options (not required for the project but would be nice to have)

In order to fullfil the requirements i will need to provide a way of parsing JSON data and make sure the POST data processing is safe and reliable. Right now the POST processing is being worked upon but is still quite unstable, so it is commented out in the `main.c`. Also will need to develop a thread management system to monitor server load. 

### Assumptions and notes

The project is supposed to compile and run on a `POSIX` compatible system, with `GNU make` and `gcc`. 

Successfuly tested on `Slackware Linux 3.9.5 #2 SMP x86_64 i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz` and `Darwin 14.3.0 PDT 2015 x86_64`

## 2 COMPILE

There are two libraries used in this project:
 
 a. libmicrohttpd 
  - https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/
  - provides web server API
 
 b. CUnit
  - http://cunit.sourceforge.net/
  - provides framework for testing

These files required for compilation:

 - `main.c` 			= the server
 - `json.c json.h` 		= json utility functions
 - `url.c url.h` 		= url processing functions
 - `terminal.c terminal.h` = terminal operations 
 - `makefile` 			= can be used for compiling and some runtime testing

To compile main project use the makefile and GNU make in the projects root directory

To compile tests use the makefile in the `tests/` directory

---
## 3 INSTALL

After successful compilation the  binary `sp_server` will be available in the project root directory. Copy it wherever seems suitable.

---
## 4 USAGE

After launching the server will be available on port 8888. For GET requests you can us a web browser:
 ```
 localhost:8888
     /terminals 			list available terminals
     /terminals/{id} 		display particular terminal info
 ```
For POST requests use curl or similar programm:
```
 curl -X POST localhost:8888/terminal 	create new terminal
```

To stop the server please press a key in the server's terminal. 

---
## 5 TESTING

Runtime tests are in `tests/test_scenarios.sh`
 - The scenarios test server operation and simulate user queries (acceptance testing)
 - Make sure `sp_server` is just started
 - Run `make test`

All function tests are in file `tests/test.c`
- At the moment there are only helper function tests checking for validity of input and some boundary conditions.
- Use `tests/makefile` to compile the tests
- Use `tests/test binary` to run tests

Note: `json_float_test` fails due to floating point format not being carefully specified, but this function is not used in the project and there fore will not be fixed in the nearest future.

### PS. Thank you

I am thankful to Smartpay for allowing me to take this test. This was very challenging and intense experience. I plan on resolving the issues even after the test's due date - at least I will have something interesting to work on.

Kind regards,

Dmitri
